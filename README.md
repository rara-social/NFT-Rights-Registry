# NFT-Rights-Registry

The NFT Rights Registry is open-sourced list of NFTs according to their copyright, trademark, and other licenses and rights.

NFT standards and the related smart contracts have no concept of law or licensing agreements off-chain. Most NFTs are sold to collectors with no mention of copyright, trademark, or other rights given to the collector. As a result, the creator has "all rights reservered" for the "work" of the NFT.  

However, many new NFT projects are registering their work in the public domain as [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/waiver) or otherwise granting explicit copyrights and trademarks licenses. 

This project is intended to create a searchable index for these NFTs.
