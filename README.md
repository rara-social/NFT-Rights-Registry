# NFT-Rights-Registry

The NFT Rights Registry is an open-sourced list of NFTs according to their copyright, trademark, and other rights.

NFT standards and smart contracts do not recognize off-chain law or licensing agreements. Most NFTs are sold with no mention of copyright, trademark, or other rights given to the collector. As a result, the creator has "all rights reservered" for the "work" of the NFT.  

However, many new NFT projects are registering their work in the public domain as [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/waiver) or otherwise granting explicit copyrights and trademarks licenses. 

Inspired by the Royalty Registry and Royalty Engine found at [Royaltyregistry.xyz](https://royaltyregistry.xyz/), this project is intended to create a searchable index for NFT rights and eventually a registry for updating rights on-chain.

# The List
CC0 NFTs - Search [CC0.dev](https://www.cc0.dev/).

For non-CC0 projects that grant copyrights or trademarks, submit an NFT or collection to our list [here](https://forms.gle/pzWoZMTDiDC5VDz99).
